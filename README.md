# Sign-Up Form
A sign-up form prototype requiring users to complete all necessary fields to create an account. This was created as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

## Motivation
This project was made to:
- Exercise creating authentic forms that include all required information.
- Practise implementing clear field validation that provides appropriate feedback to users, indicating whether the input is valid or invalid.

## Quick Start
Publicly available at the following link: https://paulreaver.github.io/Sign-up_form/

## Usage
Users can enter their credentials into each field and receive instant feedback on the validity of their input. A blue border indicates active editing, a red border signifies invalid input, and a green border denotes valid input. Once all fields are validated, users can proceed to create the desired account.
